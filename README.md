# space-shooter
A game in which you gain score by blasting asteroids made with C++ and Raylib

Currently, this Makefile works both for Windows and Linux.

For Windows, this folder is enough to compile the project, the necessary include and static library files for Raylib are already inside the directory.
No additional files are required.

For Linux, the raylib library has to be installed under /usr/lib directory.

Make sure cpp compiler is in the PATH in Windows.
